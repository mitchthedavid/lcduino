Adafruit sells a variety of LCD screens for the Arduino Uno microcontroller, but the documentation for the 18-pin LCD screen is not as good as that for the 16 pin. This repo should help you wire it and get an image running on the screen.


##Setup
You'll obviously need an Arduino board, the 18 pin LCD screen, a 3-pin potentiometer and the Arduino software on your computer. Using the wiring diagram below, connect the screen to the Arduino, as shown below:

From there, you're good to add the sketch to your Arduino
